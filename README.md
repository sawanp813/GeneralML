# Regression Practice

This repository includes ML projects involving regression, specifically related to binary classification problems. Techniques used are: polymonial feature mapping, L2 Regularization, and more. Decision boundaries are also plotted for visualization purposes in all cases.

Two datasets are used: a sample dataset consisting of 102 datapoints, each for a student and their scores on two exams, and a sample dataset consisting of a series of microchips and their performance metrics on two evaluations for quality assurance.
