Regression Problems

This folder includes ML projects involving regression, specifically related to binary classification problems, support vector machines, etc. Techniques used are: polymonial feature mapping, L2 Regularization, and more. Decision boundaries are also plotted for visualization purposes in all cases.

Two datasets are used for the regression analysis: a sample dataset consisting of 102 datapoints, each for a student and their scores on two exams, and a sample dataset consisting of a series of microchips and their performance metrics on two evaluations for quality assurance.
