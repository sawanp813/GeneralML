This project can be split into two separate tasks: binary and multi-class class classification of chest x-rays for individuals who may have been 
diagnosed with COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, or nothing at all. The file entitled 'two' corresponds to the binary classification 
task of classifying a set of patients as COVID-19 positive or negative using their chest x-rays as input. For this project, I demonstrated transfer 
learning, using VGG-16 as the base of the model and train a modified convolutional neural network to perform the task. The model achieved 100% accuracy
on the test class with a loss value of 0.35. The runnable file for this project is entitled 'binary.ipynb.' 

The second project is a multi-class classification project where patients have either been diagnosed with COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia 
or nothing at all. For this project, I utilized transfer learning once again but to train two separate models: one built upon VGG-16 and one built upon 
the DenseNet169 architecture. In this comparative task, I found that the DenseNet architecture performed better than the VGG-16 based model. The dataset 
for this project is found in the file called 'all' and the runnable file is entitled 'multiclass.ipynb.' 

The datasets for both projects were drawn from the larger 'Gradient Crescent' dataset hosted here: https://github.com/EXJUSTICE/GradientCrescent.
